# Cercily: AI Visual Brainstorming Canvas
**Executive Brief | Board Review**

---

## Page 1: The Opportunity

### Problem
**AI conversations are linear. Human thinking is not.**

Current AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) produce ephemeral, single-thread outputs. Users lose insights the moment they scroll past. No way to:
- Map relationships between ideas
- Build persistent knowledge graphs from AI interactions
- Convert AI conversations into actionable frameworks

**Result:** 80% of AI-generated insights never get operationalized. Knowledge workers run the same prompts repeatedly.

---

### Solution
**Cercily = ChatGPT + Miro + Notion in one canvas.**

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| **Conversational AI** | Chat interface with multi-model support (Gemini, GPT, Claude) |
| **Visual Canvas** | Drag AI responses onto infinite canvas as nodes |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Connect ideas, build hierarchies, collapse/expand trees |
| **Persistent Memory** | Auto-save to Notion backend, never lose context |

---

### Why Cercily, Not Others

| Alternative | Gap Cercily Fills |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ChatGPT/Claude | No spatial thinking, no persistence, no connections |
| Miro/FigJam | No native AI, manual input only |
| Notion AI | Linear docs, no visual mapping |
| Obsidian + AI plugins | Technical setup, fragmented UX |

**Cercily's wedge:** First tool where AI output becomes visual, connected, persistent knowledge—without leaving the conversation.

### Value Props (by stakeholder)

| Stakeholder | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| **End User** | 3x faster insight capture, zero context switching |
| **Team Lead** | Shared visual artifacts from AI sessions |
| **Enterprise** | Audit trail of AI-assisted decisions, IP retention |

## Page 2: Use Cases

### Enterprise & Business Decision Makers

| Use Case | Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Strategy Development** | Exec asks AI to analyze market entry options → drags key points to canvas → builds decision tree with pros/cons | Board-ready visual framework in 30 min vs 2-day consultant deck |
| **M&A Due Diligence** | Analyst queries AI on target company → highlights risks/synergies → connects to valuation nodes | Structured DD artifact with full AI conversation trail |
| **Product Roadmap** | PM brainstorms features with AI → groups by theme → connects dependencies | Living roadmap that evolves with each AI conversation |
| **Competitive Intel** | Strategy team queries competitors → builds visual competitive landscape | Always-current battle cards, auto-saved |
| **Meeting Synthesis** | Paste transcript → AI extracts decisions/actions → visual action map | Exec dashboards from raw meeting notes |

**Enterprise unlock:** Compliance-ready AI usage with traceable reasoning chains.

### Individual Users (Daily Life)

| Use Case | Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Research & Learning** | Student explores topic with AI → maps concepts visually → builds study guide | Retention 2x vs linear chat |
| **Career Planning** | User explores career paths → AI suggests options → visual decision tree | Clear next steps, not overwhelming lists |
| **Content Creation** | Writer brainstorms with AI → drags ideas to canvas → structures outline | Outline → draft in one session |
| **Personal Projects** | Planning a trip/wedding/move → AI generates options → visual comparison | Decision confidence, no spreadsheet hell |
| **Health & Wellness** | User asks AI about symptoms/diet → builds personal health map | Persistent health knowledge base |

**Consumer unlock:** AI becomes a thinking partner, not a search box.

---

## Bottom Line

**We can be the interface layer where AI insight becomes organizational knowledge.**

- TAM: $50B+ (AI productivity tools + visual collaboration)
- Wedge: Only player combining conversational AI + spatial canvas + persistence
- Moat: User-generated knowledge graphs create switching costs

**Next step:** Pilot with 3 enterprise design partners (strategy consulting, PE, tech PMO).
